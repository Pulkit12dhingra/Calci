# Calci

We use calculators in our day to day lives. Computers were also created for fast an effecient calculation. Now a days for the basic use of normal calculation we use calculators. Python has a strong library support. It even has a specified library for these computations. With the help of a Graphical user interphase it is really very easy to create a Calculater. 

Before running the code make sure you have these libraries installed in your device
1. Tkinter:-(Documentation:-https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html )
2. Math (Documentation:-https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html )

After installing these libraries Run the code and test the calculator with a sample calculation
 
Play with the code to know more about it.

Hey!!

I learned a lot from this project, I hope it will teach you the same.....

# Enjoyyy.............!!! :)
